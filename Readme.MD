Replacement Software for the W8TEE/K2ZIA Antenna Analyzer by WA2FZW
Version 3.9

The software provided here is an upgrade for the K8TEE/K2ZIA Antenna
Analyzer (See November 2017 QST). It contains many additional features
that were not in Jack's original software.

It can be used on the original version of the hardware as well as the
modified hardware developed by Glenn (VK3PE) and Edwin (PE1PWF) which
both are a bit more accurate than the original.

Much more information and a lot of troubleshooting tips can be found on
